{"name":"lama","tagline":"A MUD kit made in Lua.","body":"#Features and Explanations:#\r\n * The project is split into individual packages, with *singletons* defined in the source directory, and *classes* defined in the obj/ directory.\r\n\r\n * When a *singleton* is loaded with require() or dofile(), it is stored in the global context in an entry of the same name as the file. For example, the *Game singleton*, found in Game.lua, is stored in *_G.Game*. (There is a package loading interface in main.lua, which happens to load all of these singletons on project startup.)\r\n\r\n * When a *class* is included, is returned by the require() call for use locally.\r\n\r\n * A special table, called *Cloneable* (stored in obj/Cloneable.lua), provides psuedo-inheritance across tables. If you check the documentation, a *Cloneable* has three fundamental functions. Cloneable.clone(), Cloneable.new(), and Cloneable.initialize().\r\n\r\n * Cloneable.clone(parent) provides an interface to create a new table with its metatable index set to the given parent, which should generally be a *Cloneable*. We call this new table a *Cloneable*, as it is a clone of the parent, which should be a clone of *Cloneable*. In essence, it inherets the functions and attributes of every clone in the heirarchy all the way up to *Cloneable*. We call this a \"pure\" clone, and they generally act like classes in other languages.\r\n\r\n * Cloneable.new(parent, ...) acts like Cloneable.clone(parent) for the most part, but after creating the clone, calls its Cloneable.initialize(...) function. This essentially means this clone has been initialized for use in a practical environment. As such, we call this an \"instance-style\" clone, and they generally act like object instances in other languages.\r\n\r\n * Cloneable.initialize(...) merely performs operations that every instance of a clone should have performed. Usually this means assigning unique values, or preparing stock values.\r\n\r\n * The *Game singleton* uses an event scheduler (obj/Scheduler.lua). The *Game*'s scheduler uses timestamps based on socket.select(). This can be changed as needed.\r\n\r\n * A *Map* class is included. In the current implementation, it's just a *Cloneable* that contains a 3 dimensional grid in the format of layer->column->row (or z->y->x), though most references to locations will take arguments in the order of row,column,layer (or x,y,z). By default, The Game generates a 100x100x1 Map and fills it with generic MapTile instances, mostly just for demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\n * *config.lua* contains optional configurations for the MUD server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#Using lama:#\r\n 1. Install Lua (only tested on 5.2).\r\n 2. Install libraries listed below in your Lua implementation.\r\n 3. Run main.lua.\r\n    * Run '`lua main.lua [optional port to host server on]`'\r\n 4. ???\r\n 5. Profit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#Dependencies:#\r\n * [LuaSocket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/)\r\n * [LuaLogging](http://www.keplerproject.org/lualogging/)\r\n * [LuaFileSystem](http://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/)\r\n * [MD5](http://www.keplerproject.org/md5/)\r\n\r\n#Optional Packages:#\r\n * [lzlib](https://github.com/LuaDist/lzlib) *Required for MCCP2.*\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
